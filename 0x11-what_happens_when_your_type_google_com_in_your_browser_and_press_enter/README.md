We all want to know what happens if we type a url in an address bar of a browser,
but what also happens if what we provided is not a real url but any random word we want to search,
what also happens when hackers try to get in our session,
what is also happening when hackers are delivering their own content of hackitivism (hackitivists) to us
??????
I have all of above problems on this topic, can you please try to answer me?
